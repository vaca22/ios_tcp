/// An implementation of the `TCPTransport` protocol that uses BSD Sockets and
/// GCD to run the TCP connection. This type supports neither connect-by-name
/// nor TLS. Supporting these would be quite hard:
///
/// * On the connect-by-name front, see the discussion in
///   `init(name:address:useTLS:)` for details.
///
/// * Supporting TLS would require deep integration with Secure Transport, which
///   isn’t something I’ve even contemplate.
///
/// If you need either of these features, you’d be better off using
/// `SocketStreamTransport` or `StreamTaskTransport`.
///
/// For more information on how to to use this type, see the `TCPTransport`
/// protocol.

class BSDSocketsTransport : NSObject, TCPTransport {

    /// Creates an object that communicates over a BSD Socket connected to the
    /// supplied address.
    ///
    /// - important: BSD Sockets is not a good API for general-purpose networking
    ///   on Apple platforms because it doesn’t support connect-by-name
    ///   semantics.  Instead, you are required to resolve the DNS name into a
    ///   set of IP addresses (which can be a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6) and
    ///   connect to one of those addresses.  Doing this well is _very_ hard,
    ///   which is why we recommend that you prefer connect-by-name APIs, like
    ///   `URLSessionStreamTask` or CFSocketStream.
    ///
    ///   If you _do_ use this code directly you will have to wrap it in a
    ///   higher-level abstraction that implements [Happy
    ///   Eyeballs][HappyEyeballs].  Roughly, this involves:
    ///
    ///   1. Resolving your DNS name into a set of IP addresses
    ///
    ///   2. Connecting to each IP address in parallel
    ///
    ///   3. Using the first connection that works, and discarding the others
    ///
    ///   Alternatively, use a connect-by-name API and you get all (and more)
    ///   for free.
    ///
    /// - warning: If you use a synchronous DNS API, like `getaddrinfo`, you
    ///   must not call it on the main thread.
    ///
    /// [HappyEyeballs]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs>
