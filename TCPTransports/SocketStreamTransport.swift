/// to run the TCP connection. Out of the box this type supports both
/// connect-by-name and TLS. You could also easily modify it to support
/// connecting to a Bonjour service, working over a bound pair of streams, and
/// so on.

/// For more information on how to to use this type, see the `TCPTransport`
/// protocol.

    ///     connection.  The resulting streams are ‘owned‘ by this object. You
