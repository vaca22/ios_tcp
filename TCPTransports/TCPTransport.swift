import Foundation

/// This protocol describes an object that can manage a TCP connection in some
/// unspecified way.  Concrete implementations might use BSD Sockets,
/// CFSocketStream, or whatever.
///
/// For the sake of simplicity this protocol defines that all work must be
/// confined to a single queue.  All methods must be called from that queue and
/// all delegate methods will be called back on that queue.  The sample as a
/// whole always uses the main queue, but you could take the code and use it in
/// a program that has other queues.
///
/// Another simplification is that this protocol does not implement flow control:
///
/// * On the read side, there’s no way to stop the transport from reading all
///   the data off the connection.
///
/// * On the write side, there’s no indication that data has backed up in the
///   send buffer, so if the client issues an unbounded number of sends then the
///   transport will buffer an unbounded amount of data
///
/// In the use case illustrated by this sample — a simple interactive chat app
/// based on a line-based protocol — this isn’t a problem. In other scenarios,
/// like sending a large file, this would be disasterous.  In that case you
/// won’t be able to use this protocol or its implementations directly.
///
/// This protocol sends and receives lines.  Each implementation is responsible
/// for framing those lines on the wire.  In fact, each implementation uses the
/// code in `LineFraming.swift` to frame the lines using the standard terminator
/// used in network protocols (CR LF). It would be relatively easy to change
/// this protocol to use some other message format (something encoded in binary)
/// and then change an implementation to use a different framing and
/// unframing type.  In fact, you could even make `TCPTransport` generic in that
/// type.  I didn’t do this because I was trying to keep things simple.

protocol TCPTransport : AnyObject {

    /// A dispatch queue to which the queue is confined.  Specifically:
    ///
    /// * The client must call any methods like `start()` and `stop()` on that
    ///   queue.
    ///
    /// * The object will call all delegate methods on that queue.
    ///

    /// function.  The transport typically uses this internally but that’s not
    /// required.

    ///   stopped before releasing your last reference to it.

    ///
    /// * You calling this method
    ///
    /// * The stream stopping on its own, in which case it calls the
    ///   `didStop(transport:)` delegate callback
