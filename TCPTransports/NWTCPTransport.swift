/// to run the TCP connection. This type supports both connect-by-name and TLS.

///   provider because the only way to create an `NWTCPConnection` is via the
///   `NEProvider.createTCPConnection(to:enableTLS:tlsParameters:delegate:)`
///   method.  That means you can’t use it ‘out of the box’ here.  I’ve included
///   it here to act as a starting point if you happen to be working in that
///   context.

/// For more information on how to to use this type, see the `TCPTransport`
