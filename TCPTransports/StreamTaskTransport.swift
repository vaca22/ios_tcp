/// to run the TCP connection. This type supports both connect-by-name and TLS.
/// Out of the box this type creates a stream task in the global shared session,
/// but it would be trivial to modify it to use some custom session.
///
/// Note that streams tasks do not give any indication of connection completion,
/// so you'll never see this type in the `.starting` state.
///
/// For more information on how to to use this type, see the `TCPTransport`
/// protocol.
